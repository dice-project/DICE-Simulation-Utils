# es.unizar.disco.pnml.utils

This plugin provides some utilities to deal with PNML models, such as converting EMF-based PNML models to XML-based models that respect the PNML standard (http://www.pnml.org/).

This plugin  depends on [ *PNML Framework* ]( http://pnml.lip6.fr/ ) ([GitHub Project](https://github.com/lhillah/pnmlframework/)) v2.2.8.2 (not released yet) or higher due to bug [ pnmlframework/issues/1 ]( https://github.com/lhillah/pnmlframework/issues/1 ).
